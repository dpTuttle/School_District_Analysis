# School District Analysis

### **Overview of School District Analysis**

* The purpose of this schoool district analysis was to re-evalute student reading and math scores as it relates to school size, school type, and spending per student assuming that all 9th grade scores from Thomas High School may be compromised. The analysis omits all Thomas High Schoool reading and maths scores as it calculates math and reading passing percentages and overall passing percentages for the district and each school.

### **Results**

* As compared to the original district summary, omittimg the Thomas High School grades had a slight impact on all metrics by .1 interval. This is likely due to the fact that the average scores across all grades were relatively consistent however, omitting the 9th grades scores can account for a slight loss  in overall district performance as seen below between the two data sets:
